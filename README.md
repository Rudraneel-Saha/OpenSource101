## 🌟 Notable Projects
- **[Object and Fall Detection](https://github.com/Rudraneel-Saha/Object-and-fall-detection)**: It analyzes the images and videos provided and uses a pre trained model (YOLO-V5) to detect objects in each frame and analyzes sudden movement of objects and decides if the object is falling or not. It works on a browser interface and has suitable gateways for uploading and downloading the results.
- **[Car Price Predictor](https://github.com/Rudraneel-Saha/Car_price_data_analysis)**: It gives an approximate price of the car along with each model with referrece to the user performance, by learning form a given list of vehicles. It uses CLI for input and output, no such interactable is made yet, but in future it would be integrated with such.
